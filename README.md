SeniorSolutions
===============

2012 FIRST Senior Solution season NXT programs.

Some of code in this repo, seems to have been corrupted somehow when copied among laptops.
The programs behave different in different robots and in different tables.
There is a lot of inconsistency, specially in the csf* programs and couple others.

It is better to start fresh in a new repo from the master team laptop.

This repo will be kept as a reference, in the meanwhile.
